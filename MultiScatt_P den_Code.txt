## for pair plot

##For pair grid
grids = sns.PairGrid(df)
grids.map(plt.scatter,color="#698B69",alpha=0.4)

##You can also plot different types of graphs on the same pair grid. 
#For instance, if you want to plot a "distribution" plot on the diagonal, "kdeplot" on the upper half of the diagonal, 
#and "scatter" plot on the lower part of the diagonal you can use map_diagonal, map_upper, and map_lower functions, 
#respectively. The type of plot to be drawn is passed as the parameter to these functions. You can see the true power of 
#the pair grid function from the image above. On the diagonals we have distribution plots, 
#on the upper half we have the kernel density plots, while on the lower half we have the scatter plots.

#Take a look at the following script:

grids = sns.PairGrid(df)
grids.map_diag(sns.histplot,color="#808A87",alpha=0.9)
grids.map_upper(sns.kdeplot,color="#8B2323",alpha=0.5)
grids.map_lower(plt.scatter,color="#458B74",alpha=0.4)
